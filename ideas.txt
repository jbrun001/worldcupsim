This last part of the assignment is designed to be challenging and should only be attempted 
when you have completed the other parts. Don’t worry if you aren’t sure what to do or how 
to start. You can still get a very good mark on the assignment without completing it. 
In this final part you are to design and run a tournament using the classes and methods you have 
created above. The tournament must follow the same pattern as a world cup. A group stage with 
8 groups of 4 teams, where the top two teams go through. Followed by knockout stages to find a  
final winner.  
You could go about this task in many ways with varying degrees of complexity. The most simple 
version might determine a winner of a match randomly. More involved versions will use the player 
data of each team to determine a winner of a match. You can appropriate that data how you want. 
For example you might determine that unfit players are more likely to get injuries during the 
tournament or aggressive players are more likely to get booked. Also, consider whether you wish 
to just predict a winner or score lines and more detailed match statistics.
When you have completed your implementation complete a short description of how it works in 
the text file TournamentDescription.txt in the template. The static method runTournament() should 
start it running. 
Finally, make sure your implementation outputs effective information to the terminal describing 
match results and data

Group Stage
8 groups of 4 teams.
    all teams play each other in a group. 
    so each team plays 3 matches.
